##DEVBOT
DEVBOT is a chatbot designed to assist with front-end and back-end development topics using a hybrid approach. It combines rule-based responses with a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) model to provide accurate and detailed assistance.

##Project Overview
DEVBOT aims to help developers by providing quick answers to common questions and more detailed explanations for complex topics. The project uses a hybrid approach, integrating both a rule-based system and a machine learning model to handle a wide range of queries.

##Features
Rule-Based Responses: Handles well-defined queries related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, deployment, and more.
Machine Learning Integration: Uses a pre-trained NLP model to respond to complex or less-defined queries.
Context Handling: Manages conversation context for multi-turn interactions.
##Technologies
Backend: Node.js with Express
Machine Learning: Hugging Face Transformers (Python) or local model
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
##Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)
Python (v3.7 or later, if using a Python-based model)
